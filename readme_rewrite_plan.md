# README Rewrite Plan

Objective: Replace the playful, emoji-heavy `my-electron-app/README.md` with a concise, professional document suitable for a résumé/portfolio.

## Key Changes
1. **Tone** – Formal, third-person, no emojis, no jokes.
2. **Structure** – Standard open-source structure:
   - Project overview
   - Features
   - Architecture (brief)
   - Prerequisites & installation
   - Quick start
   - Configuration (.env)
   - Contribution guidelines
   - License & acknowledgements
3. **Word choice** – Action-oriented, highlight technical skills (Electron, React, Webpack, MediaPipe, Axios).
4. **Brevity** – Keep under ~200 lines; avoid fluff.
5. **Compatibility** – Markdown headings, code blocks, links remain.

## Implementation Steps
1. Draft professional README content offline (mental draft).
2. Replace entire content of `my-electron-app/README.md` with new text.
3. Commit changes.
